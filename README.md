Road Fighter Game using OpenGL

INTRODUCTION:

The game is a single-player type in the racing genre. The game loads with a start screen. The start screen mentions the controls used to play the game. To start the game, the user would have to press the spacebar key. When the game starts we see a forest scene wherein there is a road with lots of cars. There is a player (main car) that has to race forward while saving itself from colliding with other vehicles which act as obstacles. These vehicles(obstacles) move in the opposite direction to that of the main car (player). To save itself from colliding the player car can move in the left and right direction. The game has 2 levels. The first level has a forest scene. When the score becomes higher than 500 points, level 2 automatically starts. In level 2, the view changes to the city scene, and the obstacle cars change to more powerful racer cars. The lives and the real-time score are continuously displayed on the screen. The player car has 3 lives i.e. it can collide a maximum of 3 times with the obstacle cars, after which the game would end. When the game gets over, the score for the current game along with the highest score of all the consecutive games is displayed on the screen. The user can replay the game by pressing the spacebar key.
